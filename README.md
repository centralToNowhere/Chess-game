# Chess-game
### Simple JavaScript chess engine with UI and settings
it is possible to play online with people, but you need to run Node.js server for it.<br>
The project has been made mostly for experimenting and learning JavaScript<br>

Codebase is awful, btw

# Run locally
First, you need to have `Node.js` and `npm` installed.<br>
```
npm i
npm run build
node server.js
```
Now project is available on `localhost:4000`
# Online mode
1. create game name and remember it
2. create password and submit
3. open sidebar menu
4. send game name and password from chat message to second player
5. second player now can enter to your game session
